The solution focuses on consistently using string keys, ensuring that there is no ambiguity.  This avoids the implicit type conversion that leads to the unexpected behavior.

```php
$myArray = [];
$myArray['2147483648'] = 'a'; // Use string key explicitly
$myArray['2147483649'] = 'b';

if (isset($myArray['2147483648'])) {
  echo "Key '2147483648' exists.";
}

foreach ($myArray as $key => $value) {
  echo "Key: " . $key . ", Value: " . $value . "\n";
}
```

By consistently using string keys, you avoid the unexpected type juggling and maintain predictable array behavior.  It's crucial to remember that while integer keys are allowed, the implicit type conversion for large integers can lead to hard-to-debug issues.
