This code suffers from a subtle bug related to how PHP handles array keys and type juggling.  The issue arises when using non-string keys in arrays, particularly when comparing keys during iteration or checks.  Specifically, if you use an integer key that is outside the typical integer range for PHP (around 2 billion), it gets converted to a string, potentially leading to unexpected behavior.

```php
$myArray = [];
$myArray[2147483648] = 'a'; // A large integer key
$myArray[2147483649] = 'b';

if (isset($myArray[2147483648])) {
  echo "Key 2147483648 exists.";
}

if (isset($myArray['2147483648'])) {
  echo "Key '2147483648' exists.";
}

foreach ($myArray as $key => $value) {
  echo "Key: " . $key . ", Value: " . $value . "\n";
}
```
